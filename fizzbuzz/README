Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz”
instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of
both three and five print “FizzBuzz“.

Stage 2 - new requirements

    A number is fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
    A number is buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it


    53 should return FizzBuzz (contain 5 and 3)
    35 should return FizzBuzzBuzz (contain 3 and 5 and it divided by 5)
